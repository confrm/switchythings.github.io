                        Tasmota (<a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/">https://tasmota.github.io/docs/</a>) is a
                        open source firmware for esp8266 and esp32 devices enabling standalone control and automation
                        or integration with a wide variety of home automation systems. WiFi based SwitchyThings use the
                        Tasmota firmware.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Getting Started</h3>

                    <p>
                        From the factory all Tasmota devices create their own wifi network with the name tasmota-xx
                        where
                        the xx is as unique number for the device.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Connect to that network using a phone or similar. The phone should tell you that you need to
                        sign
                        in to the network and open a browser page for you. If not navigate to xx.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On this page you can set the SSID and password of the network you want the device to connect to.
                        Enter the details and click on "Submit". The device will reboot and attempt to connect to that
                        network. If it fails to connect it will start up the tasmota-xx wifi network to allow you to try
                        again.
                    </p>

                    <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
                        If you ever need to reset you device holding the button for 40 seconds will make it reset. If
                        the device does not have a button then turning off the wifi and power cycling the device will
                        make it start the tasmota-xx hotspot again.
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Once the device is rebooted you will get a screen like this:

                        From here you can turn the device on and off, and use the menu system to use the built in
                        automations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Integrations</h3>

                    <p>
                        The following are links to websites showing how to integrate Tasmota devices with home
                        automation systems:

                        <ul>
                            <li>One</li>
                            <li>Two</li>
                        </ul>

                        &nbsp;
                    </p>


                    <h3>3. Troubleshooting</h3>

                    <p>
                        <strong>No Internet</strong>: If you wish to use a Tasmota device on a network without an
                        internet connection you will need to set its time manually or provide a time server on the
                        network. To set the time manually go to the console and enter "xx":

                        Note that over time the accuracy of the time on the system may drift, if you are using built
                        in automations you may need to adjust the time every few weeks or months for it to stay
                        accurate.
